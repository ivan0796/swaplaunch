# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  SwapLaunch v3.0 - Multi-Chain Expansion & Enhanced Features
  
  Previous issues (COMPLETED):
  1. ✅ Token logos from TrustWallet
  2. ✅ Dexscreener integration for contract search
  3. ✅ Trading pair selection
  
  New Requirements:
  1. Add more Layer-1 chains (XRP, Tron, etc.) with native DEXs
  2. Implement chain filtering (EVM chains → show only EVM-compatible networks)
  3. Chain-prioritized token search (prioritize tokens from selected chain)
  4. Add "Token Sniffer" button in TokenSecurityPanel
  5. Trending data from CoinMarketCap (NO API key available - keeping existing implementation)
  6. Ensure token logos for WETH, DAI, etc. (already using CMC logos in DEFAULT_TOKENS)

backend:
  - task: "Token Logo URLs from TrustWallet"
    implemented: true
    working: true

ETH: trustwallet/assets/.../ethereum/info/logo.png, BNB: .../smartchain/info/logo.png, MATIC: .../polygon/info/logo.png, SOL: .../solana/info/logo.png. ERC20 tokens use checksum addresses: .../ethereum/assets/{checksum_address}/logo.png. Solana tokens use Solana token list URLs."

        comment: "Enhanced /api/token/resolve endpoint to better detect contract addresses (0x... for EVM, 32+ chars for Solana). Improved Dexscreener integration to extract logoURL from pair info. Increased results from 10 to 15. Added better duplicate filtering. Tested with USDC contract - works correctly."

      ✅ All User Issues Resolved:
      
      1. **Korrekte Token Logos**
         - Replaced all logos with correct TrustWallet GitHub URLs
         - ETH, BNB, MATIC, SOL use native coin logo paths
         - ERC20 tokens use checksum addresses
         - Fallback display shows first letter if logo fails
      
      2. **Contract-Suche verbessert**
         - Enhanced /api/token/resolve for better contract detection
         - Improved Dexscreener integration with logos
         - Tested: USDC contract (0xA0b86991...) resolves correctly
      
      3. **Trading-Paare auswählbar**
         - New /api/dex/pairs endpoint created
         - PairSearchModal component with full pair info
         - "Select Trading Pair" button in swap form
         - Auto-populates both tokens when pair selected
      
      Ready for frontend testing to verify pair selection flow.
