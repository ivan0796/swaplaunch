The AI engineer successfully guided SwapLaunch through multiple significant development phases. Initially, core UI/UX elements were standardized, including a unified navigation bar, comprehensive localization, and a clear distinction for Beta features. A dynamic tiered fee system was implemented in the backend, complete with A/B testing capabilities, and integrated into the frontend for transparent display. A referral teaser was also added. The engineer then tackled usability issues, improving menu hover functionality and removing Made with Emergent branding. Subsequently, several Beta features like Token Locker, Pro Swap, History, and Price Alerts were fully activated, ensuring non-custodial operation. Extensive legal and informational pages (Terms, Privacy, Risk, Getting Started) were created, along with a consistent global footer. The leaderboard and price alerts were made accessible without wallet connection.

The latest major initiative, still in progress, focuses on optimizing the Token Launch funnel for revenue. This involved redesigning the navigation with a , setting the default route to the new  (which features a hero section, a progress stepper, and live pricing), enhancing swap fee transparency, implementing promoted slots for trending tokens, and preparing for a new advertise page and a dedicated security page. Analytics tracking for key user interactions has also been integrated. The work is structured into phases, with Phase 3 currently underway, covering swap fee display, trending promotions, and the creation of legal/informational pages.

<product_requirements>
The SwapLaunch platform is a non-custodial, multi-DEX swap supporting EVM and Solana chains, designed to offer a robust and transparent experience for token trading and launch. User requirements have driven the implementation of:
1.  **Streamlined Navigation**: A focused header () with primary menu items (Swap, Token Launch, Lock Liquidity, Bridge) and a More dropdown. The default route is now .
2.  **Localization**: Multi-language support (EN, DE, ZH) across all core pages and new UI elements.
3.  **Content Management**: Removal of custody-like phrases, clear Beta marking for unfinished features, and later, activation of these features (Token Locker, Pro Swap, History, Alerts) with removal of Beta flags. Introduction of a detailed MEV protection explanation.
4.  **Dynamic Tiered Fee System (0.10%-0.35%)**: Applied to EVM and Solana quotes, with backend A/B testing (20% tiered, 80% fixed 0.25%) and frontend display of fees and Why this route? breakdowns.
5.  **Unified Token Logo Resolver**: A global utility for fetching token logos from various sources with fallbacks.
6.  **Referral Program**: A non-intrusive teaser on the homepage, linking to a dashboard with a leaderboard visible without a wallet.
7.  **Automated Weekly Revenue Report**: A secure, non-custodial email report for aggregated revenue, volume, and swap metrics, complemented by an  endpoint.
8.  **Trust & Security**: Comprehensive Terms, Privacy, Risk Disclosure, and Getting Started pages linked in a global footer.
9.  **Monetization Features**: Future plans include Ads Buy-Now (on-chain), Featured Token Slots, and Launchpad Pay-to-List with dynamic pricing and chain selection.
10. **Token Launch Funnel**: A new Hero section, a multi-step progress wizard, and a live pricing box on the Token Launch page.
11. **Analytics**: Vendor-agnostic tracking for user journey events (wallet connect, launch steps, swap events).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a significant frontend overhaul to focus the application's funnel on Token Launch and implement various revenue and UX improvements, as per the user's latest detailed requirements. This large task is broken down into systematic phases.

The work is currently in **Phase 3** of this initiative, following the completion of initial configuration (pricing and analytics utilities, i18n keys) and the core Token Launch page redesign. Key accomplishments leading up to this point include:

1.  **Backend A/B Testing**: Fully integrated A/B testing logic into the backend's  and  endpoints, allowing for a 20% tiered fee vs. 80% fixed 0.25% control group. A  endpoint was created to monitor key metrics for each cohort.
2.  **UI/UX Refinements**: The 's hover behavior was fixed for smoother navigation, and the Made with Emergent branding was removed.
3.  **Feature Activation**: Previously Beta features like Token Locker, Pro Swap, Swap History, and Price Alerts were activated and integrated, with Beta badges removed.
4.  **Legal & Informational Pages**: Comprehensive Terms, Privacy, Risk Disclosure, and Getting Started pages were created, along with a global  component that is now applied consistently across main pages.
5.  **Accessibility**: The Referrals Leaderboard was made visible without requiring a wallet connection, and Price Alerts were configured for non-wallet users (via local storage).
6.  **MEV Protection**: An explanatory MEV info-box was added to  to educate users on its importance.
7.  **Token Launch Funnel (Phase 1 & 2 Complete)**:
