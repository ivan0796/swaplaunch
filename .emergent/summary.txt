The AI engineer's work on SwapLaunch has significantly expanded its functionality and improved user experience. Starting with foundational elements like referral system backend and launchpad badge definitions, the project rapidly scaled to encompass a full platform overhaul. Key achievements include a multi-faceted navigation restructuring, consolidating Token Creator into a robust, multi-chain Create Project feature, and delivering a functional NFT Maker with prompt-based generation and mock asset handling. Branding was enhanced with a user-provided logo and a platform-wide color scheme adaptation. Crucially, the CoinGecko API was entirely migrated to CoinMarketCap. The engineer navigated complex user requirements, iterative design changes, and persistent technical challenges, particularly in ensuring consistent  integration across all pages, which is the immediate ongoing task.

<product_requirements>
The SwapLaunch platform is a non-custodial multi-DEX swap platform supporting EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche) and Solana, integrating 0x and Jupiter APIs. Initial requirements included UI/UX enhancements like price charts, trending tokens, intelligent auto-slippage, swap history, explorer links, and a non-custodial launchpad with dynamic fees. The project has expanded with features such as automated advertising, token locker/vesting, limit orders/DCA, project listings, MEV protection, a portfolio dashboard, and multi-language support.

Recent explicit user requests guided significant development:
1.  **Referral System:** Display-only earnings initially, with future plans for on-chain withdrawal.
2.  **Launchpad Enhancements:** Add Audit Provided, Contract Verified, Liquidity Locked, Community Rating badges, while removing Team KYC.
3.  **Unified Navigation:** Implement a consistent menu structure (TRADE, LAUNCHPAD, EARN, PORTFOLIO) with hover-dropdowns across all pages, making Swap the default homepage ().
4.  **Multi-Chain Token Creator:** Enable creation of ERC-20/BEP-20/SPL tokens with chain selection, gas estimation, and non-custodial deployment. This functionality was later merged into the Create Project page.
5.  **NFT Maker:** Develop a prompt-based AI NFT generator with preview grid, batch generation, mock IPFS/Arweave storage, ERC-721/SPL options, and non-custodial minting.
6.  **Ads System:** Transition from email applications to direct wallet-based Buy Now payments for ad slots, with automated live activation via on-chain events.
7.  **Branding & UX:** Integrate a user-provided logo, adapt the platform's color scheme to match, ensure consistent component styling, and implement a robust token logo resolver.
8.  **API Migration:** Replace all CoinGecko API calls with CoinMarketCap for trending and price data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving a critical **UI consistency and navigation issue**. The user reported that the application's menu did not function correctly, specifically noting that sub-menu items required a double-click to access and that hover functionality, as observed on , was not consistently applied across all other pages. This explicitly violates the requirement for a unified menu and consistent behavior across the entire platform.

The core of the problem lies with , which has historically struggled to integrate with the global  component. Previous attempts to integrate the  into  resulted in frontend errors (Link is not defined), leading to a temporary revert to its custom header to ensure the application remained functional.

The AI engineer is currently making the **third attempt** to unify the navigation by integrating the shared  component into . This is a direct response to the user's explicit request to rectify the inconsistent menu behavior and ensure that all menu points and sub-points can be selected from any page. The aim is to achieve full consistency, allowing hover-dropdowns and seamless navigation across all routes.

Relevant files being modified:
-   : This file is currently being edited to replace any custom header implementation with the global  component () and ensure its proper rendering within the page structure.
-   : This component, while not directly edited in the *last* action, is central to the current task. It has been extensively refactored throughout the trajectory to implement the new menu structure, handle hover-dropdowns, display the application logo, and adapt to the updated brand colors. Its correct and consistent integration into  is the immediate goal.
