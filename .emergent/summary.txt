<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the SwapLaunch application, starting from an MVP and incrementally adding features based on user feedback. The trajectory details a complex development process involving UI/UX enhancements, multi-chain support (EVM and Solana), and integrating various APIs (0x, Jupiter, Dexscreener, CoinGecko, GoPlus). Key milestones include implementing a Glassmorphism UI, intelligent auto-slippage, comprehensive token search with chain prioritization, and a non-custodial launchpad. Recent work focused on fixing UI bugs (logo display, price output), refactoring the network selector, implementing multi-language support (EN/DE/ZH), and developing an automated advertising system. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by handling changing requirements, resolving integration issues (e.g., CoinGecko rate limits), and fixing bugs, all while maintaining a non-custodial architecture. The menu structure was also refined, and a consistent Navbar was implemented across pages. The latest efforts are geared towards building a robust referral system.

<product_requirements>
The SwapLaunch project aims to be a non-custodial multi-DEX swap platform supporting EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche) and Solana, integrating 0x and Jupiter APIs with fee handling. Initial requirements focused on UI/UX (price charts, trending tokens, auto-slippage, swap history, explorer links, referral system, consistent fields, network logos, swap button), token discovery/security (search, Token Sniffer, new listings, risky token disclaimers, chain prioritization), bridging (LI.FI), and a non-custodial launchpad with dynamic fees and image uploads. The user explicitly requested trending data from CoinMarketCap (later deferred to CoinGecko due to API key absence). Later, an extensive roadmap was provided, including automated advertising, token locker/vesting, limit orders/DCA, project listings, MEV protection, portfolio dashboard, NFT launchpad, affiliate system, social proof, gasless simulation, light/dark mode, and a restructured menu.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing a comprehensive **Referral System**. The backend component, , was successfully created and integrated into , setting up the API endpoints for referral logic. The AI engineer was about to start building the frontend for the Meine Referrals page when the user provided further instructions. The user requested to add Audit Provided and Contract Verified badges to Launchpad projects, and to remove the Team KYC badge, indicating a shift in focus or refinement of previously discussed features. The AI engineer acknowledged these instructions and confirmed continuation with the referral frontend page implementation.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the frontend for the My Referrals page and integrate the requested Launchpad badges.
